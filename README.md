# DenseNet-121-Implementation
Implementation of DenseNet-121 architecture on CIFAR10 dataset and training the model for 200 epochs to improve test accuracy.
I have used Image augmentation technique using ImageDataGenerator() method.
After training the model for 200 epochs, I have got the test accuracy of 88%
